<h2>Build and publish pages</h2>
<p>When the team is confident they are solving the IA problems after completing the cycles of iteration and research, it is time to build or make necessary changes to the pages in the content management system (CMS). At NHS.UK, we use Wagtail for our CMS.</p>
<p>Your team will need to make sure all changes are reflected in the CMS in order to be ready to publish. A team review will also ensure everyone is happy with what is being changed.</p>
<p>The pages in the CMS should also reflect the page templates you are using for your new IA.</p>
<h3>Test & deploy</h3>
<p>Functional tests should be run on your new pages. These will make sure everything is working correctly across different browsers and device types.</p>
<p>At this stage, you should also consider running some final accessibility tests on your content, such as reading through the page using a screen reader.</p>
<h3>Set-up re-directs</h3>
<p>When pages are added, moved or changed you will need to make sure the URL takes the user to the new pages. You can do this by setting up a re-direct.</p>

<h2>Document what you have learned</h2>
<p>As you are reaching the end of the IA improvement work, your team should consider holding a form of retro to understand what you have learned from the work.</p>
<p>Typical retros ask 3 questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What went well?</li>
  <li>What didn't go well?</li>
  <li>What could be improved?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering these questions as a team will help to highlight any parts of the process that can be maintained, and any that should be improved for future IA projects. It is important to then document the outcomes so that you have something to refer back to, and evidence of any decisions made.</p>
<p>It may be useful at this stage to share any key learnings with other teams that may be interested, such as those working on similar projects.</p>

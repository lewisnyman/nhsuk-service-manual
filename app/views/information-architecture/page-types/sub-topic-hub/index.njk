  <h2>Main topic hub pages as routes to information</h2>
  <p>At level 1 you'll have the main topic page which routes users to subtopics (level 2).</p>
  <p>In the context of health information; Diabetes would be at level 1, Type 1 (diabetes) and Type 2 (diabetes) would be children of Diabetes at level 2, and children pages of type 1 and type 2 (information on treatments, symptoms etc.) would be level 3 and beyond.</p>

  <h3>The purpose of hub (routing) pages:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Give users the context of where they are on the website; if they need to go up a level (homepage) using breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>introduce the topic area</li>
    <li>if the heading isn't clear enough, or if you have user evidence that you need more context about the topic area, use lede text Lede (intro) text</li>
    <li>provide 'quick links' to information/services buried deep within the topic structure using Top tasks Top task / short cut links</li>
    <li>allow uses to see a high-level overview of the main topic area broken down into smaller topics using the canonical panel link</li>
    <li>provide links to related information pages, in case a users mental model of how information is organised doesn't match how we've grouped it (not all users think the same - always good to have a get-out clause). Having 'related links' also help if a user is navigating through the topic area and they've read all the needed to in that section but have a query which is related.</li>
  </ul>

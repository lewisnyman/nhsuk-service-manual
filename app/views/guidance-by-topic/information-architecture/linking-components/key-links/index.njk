  <h2>Key links on hub pages</h2>
  <p>Hub (routing) pages are good at breaking down big topic areas such as pregnancy, cancer of COVID-19 into navigable content.</p>
  <p>Hub pages are essentially a page of links. Within hub pages we found the need to link to different types of things; in-canon hub links, related (off-canon) links, top task/shortcut links, links to external charities etc.</p>
  <p>To help users visually understand the new architecture we needed to introduce a visual hierarchy to links, trying to give users a flavour of what lies beneath.</p>
  <p>Links need to be "visually prominent and obviously clickable", we also needed a link to visually set expectations for the page it was linked to and to work alongside other link types. Plus, they must work in the context of a user journey through multiple layers of hub pages</p>

  <h3>The purpose of key links</h3>
  <p>Key links are essentially a list of linked text that feature on a level 2 hub (parent) which link to child pages.</p>
  <p>They support the fundamental organising principles of IA:<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Placemaking: helps users understand what the NHS website is for and what it offers</li>
    <li>Orientation: helps users understand where they are and where else they might go</li>
    <li>Navigation: helps users get to their destination</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We need visual elements, components to support the organising principles - to help users navigate through the NHS website, help them understand where they are and where they want to go.</p>
  <p>Having the same style of link across the site for hub pages, information pages, main navigation, top tasks, related pages, external websites wouldn't provide users with enough visual hierarchy - an indication of where they are in the structure and what kind of thing they'll find when they click.</p>
  <h4>Rules of using key links</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Not link to content pages outside of the topic/parent in other canons. We use 'related links' for this. Problems will arise when mixing child (non-canon) links with canon links - we lose consistency and navigational elements - 'other' canon links with have different breadcrumbs and side to side (bottom) nav. Not having a consistent thread will become disorientating for users when researching around a topic. If a page is in another section, we have to be upfront and tell them this.</li>
    <li>Be used to link to a page of information, not another hub page</li>
    <li>Relate to a sub-level of the topic</p>
  </ul>
  <h4>Visual appearance of key links</h4>
  <p>Key links should follow this specific styling:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>bold text</li>
    <li>underlined</li>
    <li>slightly bigger than body text</li>
  </ul>

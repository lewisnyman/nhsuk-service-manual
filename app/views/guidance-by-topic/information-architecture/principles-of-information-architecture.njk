          Base your IA on user needs
        </h2>

        <p>Create a user-centred IA that groups content in a way that mirrors users' mental models of health and care.</p>
        <p>Prioritise users' top tasks and validate your navigation with real users.</p>

          Route users effectively and enable intuitive flow
        </h2>
        <p>Create a strong <a href="why-ia-is-important#information-scent">information scent</a> for people to follow and find what they need.</p>
        <p>Users must be able to navigate to any page from the home page, moving up and down information hierarchies, as well as sideways across vertical groupings.</p>
        <p>All pages must exist in navigation structures: no orphan pages.</p>

          Make content easy to find

        <p>Give users multiple ways to get to the same information.</p>
        <p>Different users have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>different finding strategies</li>
          <li>are in different <a href="">information-seeking modes</a> at different times</li>

          Make the next step clear
        </h2>
        <p>Users should not wonder "What do I do now?". No page should be a dead end.</p>
        <p>Let users know their next step or find related information by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>grouping content</li>
          <li>cross-linking</li>
          <li>using components to help them navigate</li>

          Make your IA machine-readable
        </h2>
        <p>Well-structured, tagged content is easier to navigate, search and manage.</p>
        <p>Make sure your content is accessible to Google and other internal and external search engines.</p>

          Make it robust but flexible
        </h2>
        <p>Your IA must provide a solid foundation to build on over time.</p>
        <p>It needs to accommodate new content and work for the service you want to provide as well as the service you have now.</p>
      </div>

          Be consistent
        </h2>
        <p>A consistent design, information structures and tone of voice help users orient themselves and find things.</p>
        <p>Use consistent language across menus, headings, and links. Content models and controlled vocabularies help with this.</p>
      </div>
    </li>

 <li class="featured-list--item">

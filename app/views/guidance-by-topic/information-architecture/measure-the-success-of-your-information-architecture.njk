  <h2>You need a performance framework</h2>
  <p>A performance framework is a set of metrics (things you can measure) that will help you monitor your success. Agree them early in your project and take baseline (current) measurements, then track performance against them as you improve your IA.</p>
  <p>Performance frameworks are different for every team, but you need to show:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>that you know what success looks like</li>
    <li>that you've baselined your measures</li>
    <li>evidence that your IA is successful</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Examples of measures include a percentage increase in users or lower bounce rates on important pages.</p>

  <p>To meet your users' and organisational needs, you need to demonstrate the following for any new or transformed content.</p>

  <h2>Demonstrate success through analytics</h2>
  <p>Make sure you understand your users' priority tasks and show you get more people to the information they need more easily.</p>
  <p>Show that your IA helps more users:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>find known content – you can measure this, for example, through tree tests</li>
    <li>discover unknown content – site analytics can measure journeys through content (not just single page visits)</li>
    <li>start relevant transactional journeys</li>
    <li>visit high priority content that helps them do their most common tasks – "top tasks"</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Show that users find content through search engines</h2>
  <h3 id="search-engine-optimisation-SEO-for-external-search-engines">Search engine optimisation (SEO) for external search engines</h3>
  <p>For your topic to rank highly in external search engines, you need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a clear structure, with pages grouped in a way that makes sense to users and links to navigate through all the pages</li>
    <li>content, with words your users use</li>
    <li>titles that relate to the content of the page and use words your users use</li>
    <li>metadata</li>
    <li>to address accessibility, with correct page mark up and alt tags for images</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you've changed the IA around an existing topic, it may affect search results. Baseline your search ranking and traffic from search engines and measure again when you've improved your structure and labelling. (If your content is on the NHS website, it has such authority that it's difficult to harm its Google rankings.)</p>
  <p>For new topics, monitor search rankings for keywords when they go live and then review them.</p>
  <h3>Internal search</h3>
  <p>Large websites benefit from an on-site search engine. If you have one, your site search logs should show that users find your content through it.</p>
  <p>Add synonyms for your topic and prioritise results.</p>

  <h2>Show that you've based your IA on user needs</h2>
  <p>Show that you've designed, tested and iterated your IA based on user research. This means users can browse to all your content.</p>
  <p>If you're adding to an existing website, show that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>you meet side-wide user needs as well as topic user needs</li>
    <li>you know about any larger content group your topic belongs to</li>
    <li>the labels you use sit meaningfully alongside existing content</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Show that users pick up a good information scent</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Users looking for your topic find it when they start from elsewhere on the website.</li>
    <li>The way you've grouped content and the labels you've used lead users to what they're interested in.</li>
    <li>You've considered users' journeys around the wider topic and linked to associated conditions, treatments, lifestyle improvements or services.</li>
    <li>You include links and synonyms in visible indexes – an example is the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/">Health A to Z on the NHS website</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Have page templates for different levels of your IA</h2>
  <p>IA page templates help users navigate from larger to smaller topics. They also help search engines understand the relationships between and the importance of different pages by providing a clear structure.</p>

  <h2>For teams publishing content on the NHS website</h2>
  <h3>Agree website changes with the IA team</h3>
  <p>Talk to the NHS.UK IA team early on so that your topic fits with the IA and navigation system as a whole. You can contact them via the #information-architecture channel on the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/slack">service manual public Slack workspace</a>.</p>
  <p>You need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>to agree where the topic fits in the wider NHS website IA and taxonomy</li>
    <li>topic links and synonyms in the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/">NHS website Health A to Z</a>, if appropriate – all designed, tested and added</li>
    <li>all topic content available via hub pages</li>
    <li>any related content available in the right context</li>
    <li>consistent links, page titles and URLs throughout</li>
    <li>URLs that have a clear structure, are machine- and human-readable, and follow the NHS website URL policy</li>
    <li>a content inventory that lists all related content across the NHS website</li>
    <li>strong evidence for any changes to NHS website IA templates</li>
  </ul>

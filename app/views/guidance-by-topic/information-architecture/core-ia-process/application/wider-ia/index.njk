  <h2>Step 9: Decide the final site-map</h2>
  <h3>Sitemap design & iteration</h3>
  <p>In the previous phase (ideation) the steps for creating a site-map were outlined.</p>
  <p>When you reach the stage of wanting to decide a final to-be sitemap, you should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>apply what you have learned from your previous tree tests to iterate the site-map</li>
    <li>run a final tree test</li>
    <li>analyse results from the first tree test to your final tree test to ensure there have been improvements</li>
    <li>identify any areas where you have less confidence</li>
    <li>compile data and research findings to support your approach</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Make sure that all content that needs to be included is reflected at a high level, and that labelling is consistent.</p>
  <h3>Tree test the final site-map</h3>
  <p>When you have decided your final site-map, perform a final tree test to measure how much the structure has been improved.</p>
  <p>Be mindful of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do the labels make sense to people?</li>
    <li>Is the content grouped logically to people?</li>
    <li>Can people find the information they want easily and quickly? If not, what's stopping them? Where do they go when they take the 'wrong' path?</li>
    <li>See overall success rates for each task. Can most users complete most of your task using your IA? If you ran a benchmark tree test previously, does your new IA perform better than the old one?</li>
    <li>See where people clicked first - which links have the strongest information scent for each task?</li>
    <li>See a breakdown of the different places people went in your hierarchy to try to complete the tasks. So you can see how the information scent performs, and where people go when they go “wrong”.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Step 10: Finalise the UI design</h2>
  <h3>UI design and iteration</h3>
  <p>The sitemap is realised in the form of hub pages, content pages and navigation structures - the UI that supports your topic content.</p>
  <p>You will need to review the iterations and ideas from the previous ideation phase and create a final version that uses all the learnings from the work so far.</p>
  <h3>Make sure you are using IA page templates and components</h3>
  <p>The IA templates and components are in the service manual under components and page types. They were all designed, tested and iterated mobile-first and have been found to be usable, accessible, robust, flexible and learnable. The page templates and components were designed to work as a coherent whole, not individually in isolation.</p>
  <p>The components are:</p>
  <p>LINKS</p>
  <p>The page types are:</p>
  <p>LINKS</p>
  <p>For more detail about the templates and components, see the links above.</p>
  <h3>Talk to an expert</h3>
  <p>The NHS.UK team within NHS Digital have a specific IA team who are happy to help others understand the IA guidance. Please get in touch via the service manual contact details.</p>
  <h3>First click tests</h3>
  <p>Use first-click testing to test your IA as part of your UI - to test the IA and visual hierarchy together.</p>
  <p>Your IA may work well in tree tests, but can people still find what they need in the context of the rest of the website? Can your users quickly and easily identify where content will be found when they land on your topic?</p>
  <h4>Running a first click text</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>You upload screenshots or wireframes of your prototype, showing the IA you want to test. You can use desktop and/or mobile screenshots.</li>
    <li>You can set up to 10 common tasks that users are trying to complete for your topic. Make sure you don’t set ‘leading’ tasks that use the same words as your navigation labels. Make sure you randomise the order in which participants see tasks so they’re not all learning the same thing from one task to the next.</li>
    <li>Unsurprisingly given its name, the test results show you where users clicked first in order to try to complete your tasks. A ‘correct’ first click is a great indicator of subsequent successful task completion. Does your IA provide an information scent that sets your users up for success? Does your IA get ‘lost’ within the UI?</li>
    <li>Aim for 50-100 completed tests. Patterns typically emerge around 50 completions.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Conduct usability tests</h3>
  <p>Use usability testing to understand whether your users can find the content they need. At this stage, you want to be testing a high-fidelity prototype to ensure results are as representative as possible.</p>
  <p>When testing a prototype or live website, you are testing the IA, content and UI all together. It is sometimes tricky to identify an IA problem as separate from a content or UI problem. However, if people get lost and cannot find what they are looking for, it is likely an IA problem.</p>
  <p>We can set tasks in a usability test to evaluate the IA as well as the content.</p>
  <h4>Navigation tasks in usability tests</h4>
  <p>Explicitly testing an IA is odd in that you can’t expect users to notice or comment on page furniture or navigation structures. Instead, we set them tasks that they will be able to complete if the IA is doing its job, albeit invisibly.</p>
  <p>To test navigation structures and information scent, we need to prevent people from using the search engine.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We set tasks that ask them to move down, up and sideways around our site map, and observe how easily or otherwise they can move around.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Can they get ‘down’ from a main topic landing page to a content page a couple of levels down in the sitemap to answer a question?</li>
        <li>Can they then move ‘sideways’ to answer a different question via a sibling page?</li>
        <li>Can they move back ‘up’ to the topic main page?</li>
      </ul>
    <li>We set tasks that ask them to find information outside of but related to our topic</li>
    <li>We set tasks that ask them to re-find information they were previously looking at</li>
    <li>We observe whether people understand if they are on a page that will answer their question or not. If they are not in the right place, can they correct themselves?</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Understanding IA in usability test findings</h4>
  <p>Can users follow an information scent to complete key tasks? If not, why not? Does your structure allow users to easily move around content and discover the full range of available information on the topic?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are the topic groupings working well?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Do people expect content to be grouped differently? (Hopefully, you’ve already covered this with card sorts and/or tree tests but it’s always good to back up those findings with user interviews)</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Are the topic labels providing a good information scent?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Do the words or phrases you are using make sense to users? Or are people looking for specific words or phrases but not finding them?</li>
        <li>Can people predict the information behind a link before clicking it? If users cannot accurately predict where a link will lead, there’s a problem with the link label.</li>
        <li>Can users discover the range of content available on your topic?</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Is the UI doing a good job of revealing the IA to users? If not, why not?</li>
    <li>Can users move down, up and sideways around your content? If not, why not?</li>
    <li>If someone gets lost, can they correct themselves? If so, this is a good indicator of your IA and UI doing its job well. Although, getting lost too often is clearly a problem!</li>
    <li>Can people re-find content they were looking at earlier? This is another good indicator of your IA and UI doing its job well.</li>
    <li>Can people successfully use the NHS.UK search engine to find content that meets their needs?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If our IA is doing its job well, it will be invisible. Users may say things like “that was straightforward” or “I found everything easily” and will have been able to complete their information-seeking tasks. They will not have noticed the IA or UI furniture. If they have noticed it, it is often because it has got in their way.</p>
  <p>If users are successfully navigating the information - finding what they need, correcting their errors, not getting lost too often, re-finding something they looked at previously, then the IA has tested well. If users are looking for words we have included in global navigation structures, we have chosen the right words. If users are searching for words that the site search knows are relevant to our topic, then we’ve taught the search engine the right synonyms.</p>
  <p>We don’t care which structures users interact with in order to move around our content. Whether it’s the ‘back’ button, breadcrumbs, hub page options, sibling navigation menus, in-page links, site search or some combination of these. These components have been designed to work as a coherent system, with built-in redundancy to accommodate different users having different interaction styles. As long as people can understand the range of content available to them, make an informed selection from the range and move around it as they wish, we take it as a win.</p>

  <h2>Step 11: Develop the relationship between your topic and the wider IA</h2>
  <h3>Location in the wider sitemap</h3>
  <p>Remember our <a href="ia-guidance/about-ia/ia-design-principles">IA design principles</a>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Topics rule</li>
    <li>Provide a strong information scent</li>
    <li>The Health A to Z is NHS.UK’s index</li>
    <li>Provide multiple routes to content</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Add your topic to the wider IA, based on the IA design principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Design your topic’s location within main navigation. This is the first part of the information scent for your topic</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Add your topic to the NHS.UK taxonomy</li>
        <li>Conditions, treatments and medicines live canonically in the Health A to Z</li>
        <li>Symptoms live canonically in ‘Check a symptom’</li>
        <li>Healthy living and lifestyle information lives canonically in ‘Healthy living’</li>
        <li>Pregnancy and mental health content lives canonically under ‘Pregnancy’ or ‘Mental health’</li>
        <li>Services live canonically under ‘NHS services’</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Any topic can have one or more entries in a site index, whether or not it lives canonically there.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>This is to allow multiple routes to content</li>
        <li>Which synonyms do users look for?</li>
        <li>Keep these to a minimum so as not to make the A-Z unusably long</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Provide a comprehensive list of synonyms for site search</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Add your topic to the NHS.UK controlled vocabulary<li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

  <h3>Design search results</h3>

  <h3>Consider the need for synonyms</h3>

  <h3>Governance</h3>

  <h2>Step 12: Measure if the changes you have made are working</h2>
  <h3>Compare the benchmark tree test against a new tree test</h3>
  <p>In the initial understanding phase of your IA transformation, you may have run a tree test to understand how your current content was performing.</p>
  <p>If your site did not have any current content on the topic you are focusing on, you may have run a tree test on a competitor site map.</p>
  <p>Essentially, what we want to do now is to measure whether the new IA has made improvements to the overall performance of the tree in a tree test. Therefore, you want to run a final tree test (which you may have already done earlier in this application phase).</p>
  <p>When you have the findings from the final tree test, compare them to the initial tree test results to see whether:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the overall task success rate has increased</li>
    <li>the direct success rate has increased</li>
    <li>the average speed to complete the tasks has decreased</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If your latest tree test has better scores for the above metrics, it is a good sign that your new IA is performing better than the previous one.</p>

  <h2>Moving to the next stage: Live</h2>
  <p>Now that there is a good level of confidence that the changes being suggested are working well, it is time to put them live. Follow the last phase of guidance about how to monitor your improvements once you have launched the new IA.</p>

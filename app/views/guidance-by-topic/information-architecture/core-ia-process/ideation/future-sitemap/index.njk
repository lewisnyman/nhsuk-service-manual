  <h2>Step 5: Design your future (to-be) site-map</h2>
  <h3>Sitemap design & iteration</h3>
  <p>The information architecture of your topic can be expressed as a sitemap: a hierarchical diagram of every page of content included in the topic, showing the way they are grouped and labelled.</p>
  <p>To create a sitemap:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>List all the pages of content you need to provide for your topic</li>
    <li>Group into logical ‘topic’ chunks. Create a hierarchical site map diagram for your content</li>
      <ul>
        <li>There should be no orphaned pages that it is impossible to to navigate to</li>
        <li>Start with the groups you saw in card sorting and adjust from there</li>
        <li>Groups and labels should be topics where possible, not information types or user groups</li>
        <li>Avoid pronouns where possible - they alienate people looking for information for others</li>
        <li>Use as few words as possible to get the concept across (this makes for more readable menus and hub pages)</li>
        <li>Too deep and the information scent may be weak for pages deep in the hierarchy</li>
        <li>Too wide and users may struggle to select from too many options</li>
        <li>Every page of content has a place in the site map - its canonical home</li>
        <li>Group and label the content to match users’ mental models of your topic and the vocabulary they use. The aim here is to provide a strong information scent to all content</li>
        <li>Think about the breadth and depth of the site map</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Test your site map and iterate if necessary</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Think about whether the content groups and labels match your users’ understanding of your topic (their mental model)</li>
        <li>Have you provided a strong information scent to all content? Can people predict what they will see before they click a link?</li>
        <li>Are there too many choices?</li>
        <li>Have you grouped content by type rather than topic</li>
        <li>Your researcher can run a tree test on your sitemap (or “tree”)</li>
        <li>If parts of your site map test poorly, iterate the structure and test it again</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

  <h4>Information scent</h4>
  <p>When deciding which links to click on the web, users choose those with the highest information scent — which is a mix of cues that they get from the link label, the context in which the link is shown, and their prior experiences - Neilsen Norman Group.</p>

  <br>
  <p>Good information scent is vital to a successful information architecture. At any point in their journey, do users have navigation options in front of them that allow them to make the right choice and move on?</p>
  <p>Users will keep clicking on links if the information scent is strong - they’re happy as long as they think they’re getting closer to their goal. There’s no hard-and-fast rule about how many clicks to reach your destination (although keeping it to a minimum is kinder to users.)</p>
  <p>Labelling must be consistent across links, page titles, headings, URLs, etc, or users lose the information scent and get lost and confused.</p>

  <h3>Tree test the new site-map</h3>
  <p>After you have created a candidate for a new sitemap, evaluative research in the form of tree testing, can show you how successful the new tree is.</p>
  <p>Tree tests evaluate the ‘information scent’ your topic groups and labels provide. A tree test is effectively a usability test for a navigation structure. They test the structure - the navigation ‘tree’ - rather than the visual design.</p>
  <p>Tree testing can answer questions like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do the labels make sense to people?</li>
    <li>Is the content grouped logically to people?</li>
    <li>Can people find the information they want easily and quickly? If not, what's stopping them? Where do they go when they take the 'wrong' path?</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Running a tree test</h4>
  <p>Tree tests are conducted remotely. Participants are given up to ten information-seeking tasks that they should be able to complete within the topic. They are given a text-only version of the topic hierarchy (site map) and asked where in that hierarchy they would find the answers to the set tasks.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Aim for at least 50-100 completions, but it is possible to to get many more than that. The more completions, the more certain you can be of the results. (But it’s likely that the patterns you see will be stable after around 30 completions.)</li>
    <li>Make sure you set realistic, common tasks that users are trying to complete for your topic. Set tasks that test that people can follow an information scent even to the deepest levels of your hierarchy.</li>
    <li>Make sure you don’t set ‘leading’ tasks that use the same words as your sitemap labels. (This can be tricky - it was difficult to to come up with a task for the example above without using the word “fresh”, which would have been cheating!)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When you view the tree test results you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>See overall success rates for each task. Can most users complete most of your task using your IA? If you ran a benchmark tree test previously, does your new IA perform better than the old one?
    <li>See where people clicked first - which links have the strongest information scent for each task?</li>
    <li>See a breakdown of the different places people went in your hierarchy to try to complete the tasks. So you can see how the information scent performs, and where people go when they go “wrong”. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This can then feed into iterating your information architecture - you can retain the labels and groupings that work well and tweak or scrap those that do not. You can also see where you might need to cross-link from one sub-topic to another, if users were split in where they would look for something.</p>

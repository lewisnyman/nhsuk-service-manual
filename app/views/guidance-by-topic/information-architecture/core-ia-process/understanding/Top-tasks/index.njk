  <h2>Discover and prioritise your users' top tasks</h2>
  <h3>Prioritisation research</h3>
  <p>Prioritisation research will help to inform the way you choose which of your user needs to prioritise.</p>
  <h4>Top task research</h4>
  <p>Top Tasks are a methodology devised by Gerry McGovern to help organisations understand what users are trying to accomplish using their website.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You run a survey with visitors to your website that asks users to pick their top 5 most important tasks.</li>
    <li>You provide them with a list of 30-100 potential tasks that they may be trying to accomplish.</li>
    <li>When you analyse the results, you typically find that a small handful of the many tasks account for most of the things users care about.</li>
    <li>This allows you to prioritise those tasks in your IA, UI and content design activities. You can also use these tasks to validate your designs against.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Other prioritisation methods</h4>
  <p>The full Top Tasks methodology is likely too heavyweight for most topic Discoveries. However, research to understand what your users need most from your topic content is incredibly useful. No UI can be all things to all people all the time, even when our website is “for everybody”. You still need to know what to prioritise and what has less need to be front-and-centre:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You could run a more lightweight survey asking why the user visited your topic that day</li>
    <li>You could interview users about times they have interacted with online content on your topic in the past. What were they trying to accomplish? Why? You could ask them to rank their needs during the interview.</li>
    <li>You could run a closed card sort where users prioritise content against criteria such as ‘Important’ to ‘Unimportant’, or ‘Use often’ to ‘Use never.’</li>
    <li>Search logs and analytics can help you understand common user needs and popular existing content</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Use search logs and analytics</h3>
  <p>At this stage, you will have used search logs and analytics to understand how you current content is performing and how your users think around the subject.</p>
  <p>Now, you should use these findings to understand your users' top tasks (and therefore what tasks and information need prioritising within the content). </p>
  <p>To work out top tasks, it is important to analyse and compare:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the most searched for terms</li>
    <li>the most visited pages</li>
    <li>any qualitative data that may inform what your users are looking for</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Moving to the next stage: Ideation</h2>
  <p>As this page has outlined, there are four key aspects to understand at the start of an information architecture transformation. They are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>what content (if any) you currently have</li>
    <li>how this content is performing</li>
    <li>how your users think about your topic</li>
    <li>the tasks your users want to complete in reference to this topic</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you are satisfied that you have understood these aspects, it may be a good point to document and play back to your team and stakeholders what has been found so far. Then, you can move onto the ideation stage, where you will be focusing on using the aforementioned findings to think about how to alter the IA and create iterations.</p>

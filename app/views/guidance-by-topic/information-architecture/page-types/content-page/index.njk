  <h2>Content pages</h2>
  <p>In a well-structured website, you'll have a defined hierarchy (parent and children pages) with pages organised at various levels.</p>
  <p>We've been testing visual representations of this structure with users and found a need for consistent structure on content pages - to help support a wider navigation strategy.</p>
  <p>Content pages need to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>give users the context of where they are on the website; if they need to go up a level (homepage) using breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>introduce what the page of information is about using a heading</li>
    <li>display a review date to reassure users that a page is up to date</li>
    <li>allow users to move sideways - across all pages at the same level in the topic area using the sideways navigation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Evaluating IA in usability research</h2>
  <p>Testing IA is weird in that you can’t really expect (non-IA-geek) people to notice or comment on page furniture or navigation structures. We can’t ask them to tell us ‘where they are’ in the website as that may be a meaningless question to them. We can’t ask them to tell us whether, for example, they noticed the breadcrumbs.</p>
  <p>Instead we need to set them tasks that they will be able to do if the nav structures are doing their job, albeit invisibly. So - tasks that ask them to move down, up and sideways in our information structures.</p>
  <p>It’s OK if they don’t interact with the breadcrumbs (or other structures we choose to build) or always use the ‘back’ button. As long as they are successfully navigating the information - finding what they need, correcting their errors, not getting lost too often, re-finding something they looked at previously.</p>

  <h2>The basics of IA</h2>
  <p>Information architecture (IA) is the structural design of information environments... The organisation and labelling of websites and other digital products to support usability and findability.</p>
  <h3>IA as structure</h3>
  <p>IA underpins the structure and data that powers a website. Essentially, it is the foundations of how data is organised, stored and presented to a user.</p>
  <h3>IA as the interface</h3>
  <p>IA is also the visual representation of the structure of the website.</p>
  <p>It encompasses the components and page templates that visually organise content to support users in navigating across the site and finding the value within the content.</p>
